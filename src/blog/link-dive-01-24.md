# Links 01-24
I went on a link deep dive as I was researching a few topics today. Here's what I found.

- [This tool](https://omgnow.rknight.me/) that embeds your omg.lol `/now` page on your website
    - I'm considering moving this site to [11ty](https://11ty.dev) for more control over how it looks (I can't sigure out how to change any of the defaults on the weblog...if you have any details on this, [let me know, please and ty](/contact).
    - I also found [this themes page](https://11tytheme.sjoy.lol/) on [Sara's website](https://sjoy.lol).
- [sia.codes' blogroll](https://sia.codes/rolls/). I have a whole list of blogrolls saved. One day I'll make my own 🤞🏾
    - Here's [Sia's favorite books of 2025](https://bookshop.org/lists/2025-favorite-books-sia-s-books).
- Today I learned you can [export your highlights from Libby](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6151.htm). This knowledge will make my life much easier 😅

## Neurodivergent Cooking
One of my focus areas this year is to cook more. I want to work with my C-PTSD, anxious, depressed brain on this.
