# Hello, world!
I just joined this [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) community today. My laptop has bricked itself and disconnected the hard drive, which means all my data might be gone, including all my [digital garden's](https://zeebots-garden.vercel.app) files. I had been slacking on my hard drive backup too :( We'll see if OneDrive did its job.

In an attempt to not be upset about this, and to simplify posting on my end even further, I came here. I've had my eye on this service for a while, but needing a place to write publicly without a laptop made me finally take the leap. I love all the features they offer. I think I'm gonna like this place.

Now to add tons of slash pages.
