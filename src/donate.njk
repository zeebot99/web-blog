  <h2>Please don't.</h2>
  <p>I have a job in cybersecurity through which I make more money than I could ever dream of doing what I love. Me and my family are doing fine. Please, <i>please</i> go give your money to people who need it instead.</p>
  <h3 id="an-unordered-list-of-places-who-could-use-support-">An unordered list of places who could use support:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.aclu.org">The ACLU</a> and other human rights organizations in their fight for human rights (they're currently fighting ICE!)</li>
  <li>Your local mutual aid network, which you can find at <a href="https://www.mutualaidhub.org/">Mutual Aid Hub</a>.</li>
  <li>Food banks! Did you know that they can <a href="https://localfoodbank.org/better-to-donate-money-to-food-bank-than-donate-canned-food/">do more with money than food donations</a>? But if you can only give food, here's <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-blog/what-donate-food-bank-and-what-avoid">what to donate</a>.</li>
