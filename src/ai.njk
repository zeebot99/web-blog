            No AI, generative or otherwise, was used to make this site or anything on it. I also do not knowingly contribute to training any AI 
            product or feature, excluding hosting my code on GitHub. In fact, my <code>robots.txt</code> file explicity blocks every web crawler 
            except a select few, such as the Internet Archive. I do not plan to change this anytime soon.
